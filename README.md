# github-rebase-is-broken
A repo to indicate how broken Github's rebase merges are.

It is easy to see, because if it weren't broken, this commit should have the same id in all four branches: [feature](https://github.com/xargi/github-rebase-is-broken/tree/feature/add-some-stuff), [main](https://github.com/xargi/github-rebase-is-broken/tree/main), [staging](https://github.com/xargi/github-rebase-is-broken/tree/staging) and [prod](https://github.com/xargi/github-rebase-is-broken/tree/prod)
